## Adaptation to Seismic Surveying Domain

### Domain Mapping: Aorta → Seismic

**Signal Processing Core (IDENTICAL APPROACH):**
- **Aorta:** Pressure wave echoes in arterial blood flow
- **Seismic:** Seismic wave echoes in geological strata

**Echo Formation Physics:**
- **Aorta:** Impedance discontinuities at bifurcations, valves (reflection coefficient α)
- **Seismic:** Acoustic impedance contrasts at geological layer boundaries (reflection coefficient R)

**Signal Model (SAME MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE):**
- **Aorta:** s(t) = p(t) + α·p(t-τ) (pressure pulse + echo)
- **Seismic:** s(t) = p(t) + R·p(t-τ) (seismic pulse + echo)

**Homomorphic Analysis (IDENTICAL TECHNIQUE):**
- **Both:** log S(ω) = log P(ω) + log H(ω) → Cepstral analysis
- **Both:** Quefrency peaks reveal echo delays → distances

**Inverse Problem (SAME STRUCTURE):**
- **Aorta:** Find catheter position from echo pattern
- **Seismic:** Find geological layer depths/locations from echo pattern

**Quantum Advantage (SAME ALGORITHM):**
- **Both:** Grover search for position/depth estimation
- **Both:** O(√K) vs O(K) speedup for large search spaces
- **Both:** QFT for frequency domain analysis
