# Claude Code Tool Mapping

This file defines how LLMunix framework components map to Claude Code's native tools and their real-world characteristics.

## Tool Mappings

### WebFetcherTool → WebFetch
- Framework tool for web fetching
- Capabilities include HTML parsing and text extraction
- Low cost ($0.001-0.01 per call)
- Potential error modes like timeout and rate limiting

### FileWriterTool → Write
- Used for writing files in workspace
- Supports text files, JSON, CSV, markdown
- No direct cost
- Low latency (under 100ms)
- Potential errors like permission denied or disk full

### FileReaderTool → Read
- Reads files from workspace
- Supports text files, images, structured data
- No direct cost
- Low latency (under 100ms)
- Potential errors like file not found

### SearchTool → Grep/Glob
- Performs regex and content searches
- Supports file filtering
- No direct cost
- Low latency (under 1 second)
- Potential errors like invalid regex

### SystemTool → Bash
- Provides full system access
- Can manage packages and perform file operations
- Variable cost and latency
- Potential security and timeout restrictions

### SubTaskTool → Task
- Creates parallel execution contexts
- Enables complex workflows
- Medium cost (spawns new agent)
- High latency (30s-5min)

### HumanInTheLoopTool → Interactive Input
- Allows human intervention
- Supports complex decisions
- High cost (human time)
- Very high latency (minutes-hours)

### QuantumComputingTool → Bash + Write + Read
- Specialized quantum computing environment management
- Qiskit dependency installation and execution
- Quantum circuit simulation and analysis
- Medium cost (package installation + computation)
- Variable latency (30s-5min depending on circuit complexity)
- Potential errors like import failures, simulation timeouts, memory limits

## Cost Model
- Token cost estimates range from 50-50,000 tokens per operation
- Time estimates vary from immediate to interactive

## Real-World Constraints
- Respect rate limits
- Implement security measures
- Design for reliability with retry and fallback strategies

## Training Data Collection
The system logs detailed metadata for each tool call, enabling continuous learning and optimization.
